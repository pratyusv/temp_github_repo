Zookeeper provides a per client guarantee of FIFO execution of requests and linearizability of all requests that change the Zookeeper state.

It does not use distributed locks, as using locks can result into slow down or a faulty client might slow down the performance of faster client. It uses wait free data objects organized heirarichally as in file systems.


Client APIs

create(path, data, flag)
delete(path, version)
exists(path, watch)

getData(path, watch)
setData(path, data, version)


getChildren(path, watch)
sync(path)
