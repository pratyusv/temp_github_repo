The objective of machine learning is to find a function $$f$$ for a data set $$\mathcal{D} = \{(\textbf{x}, \textit{y}) \vert i = 1,...n\}$$ that can correctly predict the unseen data from the dataset.

### Supervised Learning
There are two basic approaches for supervised learning:
1. Restrict the class of functions to be considered.
2. Assign prior probabilities to every possible function, where the higher probabilities are assigned to more likely functions.

One can think of a function as an infinite vector, with each entry specifiying the value of $$f(x)$$ at $$x$$.
