Cassandra is a distributed, decentralized, and highly available NoSQL database. Its architecture is based on Dynamo and BigTable. Cassandra can be described as a BigTable-like datastore running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure. Cassandra is also a wide-column store and utilizes the storage model of BigTable, i.e., SSTables and MemTables.
