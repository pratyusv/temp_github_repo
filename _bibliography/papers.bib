  abstract={Synthesis of a feedback controller for nonlinear dynamical systems like a quadrotor requires to deal with the trade-off between performance and online computation time of the controller. Model predictive controllers (MPC) provide excellent control performance, but at the cost of a very high online computation. In this paper, we present our experience in approximating the behavior of an MPC controller for a quadrotor with a feed-forward neural network. To facilitate the collection of training data, we create a faithful model of the quadrotor and use Gazebo simulator to collect sufficient training data. The deep neural network (DNN) controller learned from the training data has been tested on various trajectories to compare its performance with a model-predictive controller. Our experimental results show that our DNN controller can provide almost similar trajectory tracking performance at a lower control computation cost, which helps in increasing the flight time of the quadrotor. The hardware requirements of our DNN controller is also significantly less than that for the MPC controller, thus the use of DNN based controller also helps in reducing the overall price of a quadrotor.},

  abstract={In  this  paper,  we  discuss  the  usage  of  IoT  devicesand their impact on our day-to-day life. We then explore variousside-channel attacks that IoT devices are prone to, and what aresome different types of attacks which can be done on IoT devices.We also discuss some already implemented attacks on IoT devicesin the past that have led to leakage of private data. Further, wediscuss  some  possible  techniques  to  covertly  exfiltrate  a  givenmessage  string  using  the  Magic  Blue  Bluetooth  bulb  using  bothNon-invasive  and  Semi-invasive  methods.},
