I am currently working at Microsoft India Development Center, Hyderabad, India, as a Software Developer. Prior to that, I worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Adobe. 

I completed my Master of Science by Research from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of [Prof. Indranil Saha](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/){:target="\_blank"}. I have completed my Bachelor of Technology from Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, Sultanpur in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Before my Masters, I have
 worked with the likes of IFFCO and Alcatel-Lucent (Now Nokia). I had spent the summer of 2019 at VERIMAG Labs Grenoble, France as a Visiting Research Scholar working under the supervision of [Prof. Thao Dang](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/PEOPLE/Thao.Dang/){:target="\_blank"}.
